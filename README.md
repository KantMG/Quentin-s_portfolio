# Hello! I'm Quentin Moreno-Gelos!

I'm a passionate Theoretical Physicist/Data Scientist skilled in Python. I enjoy creating projects that solve real-world problems and love collaborating on open-source initiatives.

## 📖 About Me

- 💼 After an enriching journey as a theoretical physicist, delving deep into complex problems and analytical thinking, I'm now excited to transition into data analytics, where I can apply my analytical skills to uncover insights and drive data-driven decision-making.
- 🎓 Graduated with a Phd degree in theoretical laser-plasma physic.
- 🌱 Always learning: Currently exploring deep learing.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few projects that I've been working on:

### [Project 1: Data analysis of the ILMB database](https://github.com/KantMG/Cinema_Project/blob/master/README.md)
- **Description:** THIS PROJECT ENLIGHT THE EVOLUTION OVER THE YEARS OF THE MOVIE AND SERIE MAKING.
THE ADAPTATION OF THE WAY OF PRODUCTION AS WELL AS OUR WAY OF CONSOMATION ARE ANALYSED.
HOW MUCH THE COUNTRIES ARE INVESTING IN THE FILMS PRODUCTION AND WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF INFLUENCE OF A COUNTRY OVER THE OTHERS.

- **Information on the dataframe:**
- * The IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets has been used to perform this study, the open source can be find [here](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
  * It corresponds to a multiple variety of tab-separated-values (TSV) formatted files in the UTF-8 character set.

- **Work achievement:**
- * Creation of a user friendly Dash interface for the IMDb dataframe analysation.
  ** The Python library Dask is used over Pandas in order to handle the larger-than-memory datasets thanks to Parallel Computing.
  ** Data extraction and merging between the many data files are optimized.
  ** The interface offer a wide range of plot management thanks to many dash callback function.
- * Study Highlight

- **Tech Stack:** Python, Dash, Dask, CSS
